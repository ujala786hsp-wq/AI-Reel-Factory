"""Module 1 (fallback) — free-API ideation when the Claude Routine didn't run.

Contract:
    what it does : produces the same idea rows as routines/ideation.md, via Gemini/Groq.
    how to use   : `run_fallback_ideation()` — called by the orchestrator only when
                   Supabase has no pending ideas for today (rule 11/12).
    depends on   : src.llm, src.db, src.config.

ToS (rule 4): this uses the Gemini/Groq DEVELOPER APIs — never Claude. Same JSON contract
and the same sensitivity/sourcing rules as the Routine (docs/08-news-niche-playbook.md).

CAVEAT (honesty over polish): unlike the Claude Routine, the free dev APIs have no live web
search here, so model-supplied source URLs may be stale/uncertain. This is a rare-day backup;
the human Telegram approval is the safety net, and the scriptwriter still cites sources. Ideas
that don't carry >= MIN_SOURCES plausible URLs are dropped rather than shipped unsourced.

_PROMPT = """You are the ideation engine for "But It Matters", a channel of daily, punchy \
**25-30 second** news/info Shorts (India + world). Turn the SELECTED stories below into {n} \
TIMELY ideas a human will approve 4-5 of — each a single crisp on-point fact that still carries \
one honest "why it matters" angle (not a bare summary), with strong scroll-stopping, \
share-worthy potential.

SELECTED DISTINCT STORIES (write EXACTLY ONE idea per story, in order; NEVER two ideas on the \
same event):
{selected}

PRIMARY ANCHOR — REAL CURRENT HEADLINES (verify the facts against these; prefer these real \
stories over generic evergreen topics):
{headlines}

SUPPLEMENTARY TREND SIGNAL (optional flavour only; ignore generic weather/calendar/sports-score noise):
{trending}

WINNING TITLE STYLES ON THIS CHANNEL (these actual published titles + view counts show what the \
feed rewards — copy the ENERGY and framing, never the exact title; if empty, ignore):
{winners}

HONEST SCROLL APPEAL: pick the angle a smart person finds genuinely surprising or consequential \
— real stakes, money & power, conflict with real consequences, science/space, big human impact. \
The hook must be a TRUE curiosity gap the explainer can actually CLOSE (a bait topic the facts \
can't support gets suppressed). Apply a SHARE TEST: would someone send this to a friend? Set \
share_score by that; set est_score by how strong an HONEST hook plus a real "why it matters" \
angle the story supports — never by how dramatic a title you could slap on it.

SCORE CALIBRATION (IMPORTANT): RANK the ideas against each OTHER and SPREAD the scores across the \
full 0.0-1.0 range — do NOT give everything ~1.0. The strongest single idea may approach 1.0, the \
weakest should sit near 0.3-0.5, and the rest in between. Use DISTINCT share_score values so the \
list has a clear best-to-worst order; est_score may differ from share_score per idea.

ACCURACY (CRITICAL — this is the #1 rule): propose only REAL, verifiable developments that \
ACTUALLY happened recently. NEVER invent product names, version numbers, launches, statistics, \
quotes, or events, and never attribute a claim to a company/person unless it's real. If unsure a \
thing genuinely happened, DO NOT make it up — choose a different real story. When unsure, \
generalize truthfully rather than invent specifics. Fabricated news = instant demonetization and strikes.

FRAMING RULES: the standard is TRUTH, not neutrality. Say what the evidence actually supports, \
even when that is unflattering to a government, company or party — a well-sourced conclusion is \
not "taking a side". You MAY reach a verdict and say plainly who is responsible, provided every \
load-bearing fact is verifiable and cited. What you may NOT do is assert anything you cannot \
source: an unverifiable claim is worthless however satisfying it sounds. Politics, government \
actions and court rulings are fully in scope. EXCLUDE only: communal/religious incitement or \
hate; anything that could inflame violence; unverified rumors/claims stated as fact; deepfakes/\
impersonation; graphic tragedy exploitation; medical/financial advice stated as fact.

Each idea: a PUNCHY, curiosity-driven title honest to the story (NOT a dry "X explained" search \
title, NOT a bait title the facts can't back); a story that lands in 25-30 seconds (a single \
development with a sharp angle, not a deep-dive); a "hook" that is a genuine first-2-seconds \
scroll-stopper (one surprising true fact); and a share_score.

SOURCES — READ THIS CAREFULLY: real citations are attached AUTOMATICALLY from the live search \
and the news feed above, so you do NOT need to supply them. Put a URL in "sources" ONLY if you \
are certain that exact page exists; otherwise return "sources": []. An empty list is CORRECT \
and costs nothing. A guessed or pattern-matched URL is worse than none: it 404s, the idea is \
discarded, and >= {min_src} real sources are needed to ship.

Return ONLY JSON:
{{"ideas": [{{"niche": "impact-news", "title": "...", "hook": "the first 3 seconds", \
"angle": "the original why-it-matters take", "est_score": 0.0, "share_score": 0.0, \
"sources": ["https://...", "https://..."]}}]}}
