"""Module 3 — Scriptwriter (History Documentary).

Contract:
    what it does : turns an approved idea (+ its sources) into a script via a template.
    input        : idea dict {id, title, hook, angle, sources, ...}; template name (default 'N').
    output       : {script_id, script_body, caption, hashtags[]} — also written to `scripts`.
    depends on   : src.llm, src.db, templates/*.md (design source), src.config.

ORIGINALITY IS THE MONETIZATION GATE (docs/08 §1): the script's core value is the
"why it matters" ANALYSIS, not a summary. Rewrite facts in own words + cite. Caption must
include source links + an AI-disclosure line. Keyword-rich title (SEO). Append #Shorts.

The compliance requirements (source links, AI-disclosure line, #Shorts) are enforced in
code AFTER the LLM responds — never trusted to the model, because they gate monetization.

TONE: cinematic, authoritative, and reflective — like a BBC documentary voiceover. The
delivery tags are [serious], [curious], [whispers], [pause] — NOT sarcastic or deadpan.

_PROMPT_N = """You are the lead documentary scriptwriter for a history channel — cinematic, \
authoritative, and reflective narration for **45-55 SECOND** YouTube Shorts. Your voice is the \
calm, knowing storyteller of a BBC or Ken Burns documentary: measured, vivid, and deeply human. \
You make the past feel immediate and consequential without ever lecturing or sensationalizing. \
No sarcasm, no jokes, no modern commentary — the story itself carries the weight.

IDEA: {title}
HOOK: {hook}
ANGLE (the take to develop): {angle}
SOURCES:
{sources}

WHAT WINS ON THIS CHANNEL: a single vivid moment or surprising truth that opens a window into \
a larger historical story. Lead with a specific image, sound, or decision — not a summary. \
The viewer should feel they are THERE, then understand why it still matters. Promise == payoff.

Write a **45-55 SECOND** narration — about **110-135 words** (aim for the FULL length; do not \
cut it short). Structure it:
1. VIVID OPENING (first ~3s): a specific moment, image, or decision that drops the viewer into \
the story. No "in this video", no throat-clearing, no rhetorical questions.
2. CONTEXT & TENSION (3-4 sentences): what was at stake, who was involved, what hung in the \
balance — in your own words, accurate, with sensory detail.
3. THE TURN (1-2 sentences): the consequence or revelation — "Here's why it matters..." — said \
plainly and with weight.
4. REFLECTIVE CLOSE: a final line that echoes the opening image and lands the legacy + 2-3 word \
CTA. Fill the full 45-55 seconds — don't end early. Read it aloud to check the pacing.

WRITE FOR THE EAR: short punchy sentences, natural rhythm, deliberate pauses. Sound like a \
documentary narrator — not an essay, not a news anchor, not a teacher. No hateful or personal \
attacks; the historical record speaks for itself.

DELIVERY DIRECTION (this is how it will be READ ALOUD):
Write for the ear first. Short sentences, natural rhythm. Use "..." for a deliberate beat or \
hesitation — it changes the timing on every voice engine.
Then add AT LEAST 1 and AT MOST 3 delivery tags. The one that is REQUIRED is a tone tag on the \
"why it matters" turn — that line is the whole point of the video, and read in the same calm \
register as the story before it, it can fade into the background. The rest are optional:
- [pause] or [pause long] for a beat before a revelation or the "why it matters" turn.
- [serious] for the "why it matters" turn — this is the one that tells the audience you mean it.
- [curious] on an opening image or question, [whispers] on a quiet, intimate aside, [pause] before \
a name, date, or consequence lands.
Tags are stage direction, never narration — never write a tag the sentence already says out \
loud, and never open the script with one. Fewer is better: a tag on every line reads as noise. \
The failure mode is a narrator who ANNOUNCES the gravity; restraint reads as confidence.

ACCURACY (THE ONE HARD LINE): VERIFY the historical event actually happened (use the sources + \
web search). State ONLY facts you can support. NEVER invent names, dates, quotes, figures, or \
events. Sharpen the FRAMING, never fabricate the STORY — a made-up fact gets the channel struck \
and demonetized. If the record is disputed, say so plainly.

TRUTH OVER NEUTRALITY: you are NOT required to be even-handed when the historical record points \
one way. If the evidence is clear, say so — a well-sourced conclusion is not bias. But the trade \
is strict: the sharper your verdict, the more certain its supporting facts must be. Every \
load-bearing claim has to be something a viewer could check. An independent fact-check runs on \
this script before it is voiced, and unsupported claims kill the reel — so do not reach for a \
dramatic claim than your sources can carry.

ALSO produce, for the feed + discoverability:
- "title": a clear, curiosity-driven YouTube title (<=70 chars) that is TRUE to the video — \
front-loading the most interesting REAL word.
- "caption": an ATTRACTIVE, high-retention YouTube description structured cleanly:
  Line 1: A gripping curiosity hook with a relevant emoji (YouTube shows ~2 lines in-feed to make viewers click 'more').
  Line 2: A 1-2 sentence compelling summary of why this matters + a comment trigger question (e.g., "💬 What surprised you most? Comment below!").
  Line 3: The real source link(s).
- "tags": 12-15 specific high-traffic search terms & long-tail phrases people type on YouTube \
(topic, key figures, places, era, and close search intent synonyms). No '#'.
- "key_points": 2-3 ULTRA-SHORT on-screen text cards (<=4 words each) — punchiest facts or dates.

Return ONLY a JSON object, no markdown fences. Write every line break inside a string as the \
two-character escape \\n — a raw newline inside a JSON string is invalid JSON:
{{"title": "the honest, gripping title", "script_body": "the spoken narration", "caption": "emoji hook line first\\n\\nwhy it matters summary + 💬 comment question\\n\\nSources: ...", "hashtags": ["#keyword", "#Shorts"], "tags": ["high traffic search term", "long tail phrase"], "key_points": ["short card", "another"]}}

surprising fact already in the script, or a real question the viewer needs answered. Keep the \
rest of the narration.

HARD RULE — DO NOT add, remove, or change any FACT, name, number, date, quote, statistic, or claim. \
